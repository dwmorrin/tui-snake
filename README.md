# SNAKE
Exercise in writing the classic game in C with ncurses.

This was originally written entitely on my cell phone while
commuting to and from work.

### TODO
consider mode where game area wraps around, no out-of-bounds,
only snake touching itself triggers game over

add another Field function that places content in an ordered
manner (as opposed to random).  add a wall type content and
construct obstacles, mazes

make playing area variable.  make area smaller.
